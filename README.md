# Prediction_of_Products_Sales!
Leveraging Machine Learning to Optimize Retail Sales Predictions  
 
**Author**: NATUMANYA DUNCAN  

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**:The problem we are trying to solve in this analysis is "Sales Forecasting in Retail." Specifically, we aim to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast sales for retail products based on various factors and attributes. This problem is important for retailers as it helps them make informed decisions regarding inventory management, pricing strategies, and overall business planning.
**METHODS USED** : some of the methods used were  
**Data Preprocessing**:

Handling Missing Data: Techniques like dropping rows with missing values or imputing missing data were used to ensure the dataset is suitable for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to extract valuable information for modeling. For example, transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing and exploring the dataset to understand data distributions, correlations, and identify potential patterns or trends.
EDA helps in gaining insights into the data and guiding feature selection.
Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression: Building a linear regression model as a baseline to establish a simple predictive framework.
Random Forest Regression: Utilizing a Random Forest regression model to capture non-linear relationships and interactions within the data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance.
Evaluation Metrics:

Employing evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the models' predictions.
Metrics used include R-squared (RÂ²) to measure the proportion of variance explained by the model and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify prediction errors in the same units as the target variable.  
**SOME OF THE RESULTS INCLUDE:**
